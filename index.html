                <section>I am writing to express my interest to join the team in the HNGi8 internship program. I was recommended to this program by a friend and I signed up recently. I recently developed interest for website development and I can say the experience has been beautiful. It's been three months since I started this journey and I'm confident about the little I've learnt and what I've been able to do. I'm well versed in HTML, CSS and Javascript programming languages. I can create a couple of designs perfectly.</section>
                <section>
                    <p>With this handful of skills I've mentioned above, I'm certain I'll be of great essence to the team. I'll be able to share ideas with my teammates and even learn further. The main reason I would like to join the team is to widen my scope on programming and gain expertise with like-minded people. I strongly believe that I am a reliable resource to this platform. I'm well organized, detail oriented and able to work in a fast-paced work environment. I have time management skills and a very high degree of commitment to my work. I'm sure we can work together to achieve a common goal.</p>
                </section>
                <section>Thank you for taking your time to review my application form. I am available at your convenience.</section>
                <br>
                <br>Sincerely,
                <br>Faith Oladele.
